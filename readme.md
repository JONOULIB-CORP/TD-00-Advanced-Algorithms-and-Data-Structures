TD 00: Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures
This repository contains implementations of advanced algorithms and data structures as part of the INFO: 5059 Search Base Software Engineering course. Each exercise focuses on a specific problem and provides a Python solution along with test cases.

Exercises
Binary Search

File: binary_search.py

Description: Implements the Binary Search algorithm to find a target value in a sorted list.

Time Complexity: O(log n)

Graph Traversal (BFS and DFS)

File: graph_traversal.py

Description: Implements Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) for traversing an undirected graph.

Time Complexity: O(V + E)

Dynamic Programming (Knapsack Problem)

File: knapsack_problem.py

Description: Solves the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming to maximize the value within a weight limit.

Time Complexity: O(n * W)

Merge Intervals

File: merge_intervals.py

Description: Merges overlapping intervals from a given list of intervals.

Time Complexity: O(n log n)

Maximum Subarray Sum (Kadane’s Algorithm)

File: kadane_algorithm.py

Description: Finds the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum using Kadane’s Algorithm.

Time Complexity: O(n)
