- **File:** `graph_traversal.py`
- **Description:** Implements Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) for traversing an undirected graph.
- **Time Complexity:** O(V + E)

### 3. Dynamic Programming (Knapsack Problem)
- **File:** `knapsack_problem.py`
- **Description:** Solves the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming to maximize the value within a weight limit.

### 4. Merge Intervals
- **File:** `merge_intervals.py`
- **Description:** Merges overlapping intervals from a given list of intervals.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)

### 5. Maximum Subarray Sum (Kadane’s Algorithm)
- **File:** `kadane_algorithm.py`
- **Description:** Finds the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum using Kadane’s Algorithm.
